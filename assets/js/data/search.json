EEGs are commonly utilized to monitor and detect patterns in brain activity. They have relatively short time constants, can function in most environments, and require relatively simple and inexpensive equipment. For these reasons, EEG is a very popular noninvasive brain signal acquisitioning tool and will be our researchâ€™s main method for capturing brain activity and allowing users to control the prosthesis with the data. Another commonly used method for measuring brain signals is MEAs which can be more accurate than EEGs and focus on specific areas of the brain rather than reading data from the entire brain like EEGs." } ]
