## Welcome to BCIPRO!

### About our Research

People can lose essential body parts such as their arms and legs for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, circulation problems, traumatic injuries, strokes, cancer, and birth defects. The most common way to empower them is through artificial limbs, otherwise known as prosthetics. Unfortunately, many prosthetics are immovable and the more modern versions that come with increased functionality are still limited and usually do not work like biological body parts. Our research aims to to develop a brain computer interface (BCI) prosthesis utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) and/or microelectrode arrays (MEA) technology for a more flexible and comfortable experience. 

### Research Questions

* How can we improve existing BCI prosthetics technology?

* How can we build a noninvasive brain-computer (brain-machine) interface (BCI) to control prosthetic limbs?

* How can we further understand brain wave readings from EEGs?
